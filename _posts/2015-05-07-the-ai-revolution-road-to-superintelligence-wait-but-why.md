A serial entrepreneur who made his first fortune in the early days of the world wide web, he has since helped found a solar-power company to generate green electricity, an electric-car firm to liberate motorists from the internal-combustion engine, and a rocketry business-SpaceX-to pursue his desire to see a human colony on Mars within his lifetime."

    description: "Updated May 12, 2015 11:39:11 Australian scientists are one step closer to creating a bionic brain after developing a nano memory which is capable of storing information in the same way as the biological counterpart. Researchers from Melbourne's RMIT said the device, which is 10,000 times thinner than a human hair, imitates the brain's complex engineering with its twisted mass of neural pathways."

description: "Note: The reason this post took three weeks to finish is that as I dug into research on Artificial Intelligence, I could not believe what I was reading. It hit me pretty quickly that what's happening in the world of AI is not just an important topic, but by far THE most important topic for our future."
