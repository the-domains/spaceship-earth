    description: "ELON MUSK busies himself building other people's futures. A serial entrepreneur who made his first fortune in the early days of the world wide web, he has since helped found a solar-power company to generate green electricity, an electric-car firm to liberate motorists from the internal-combustion engine, and a rocketry business-SpaceX-to pursue his desire to see a human colony on Mars within his lifetime."

    description: "In all candidness, I shouldn't have been in Solomeo. I don't write for a big fashion magazine. I have no credibility in Brunello Cucinelli's world.
